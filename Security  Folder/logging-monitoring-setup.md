# Logging and Monitoring Setup â€“ Sprint 1 Deliverable

## Objective
Establish centralized logging and monitoring for observability and threat detection.

---

## Tools Used
- **Firebase Analytics**: Logs client-side events and usage.
- **Cloud Logging (GCP)**: Collects logs from Firebase Functions and Hosting.
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)**: Self-hosted setup for ingesting logs from dev servers and VPN.
- **Azure Sentinel (Optional)**: Connected to Wazuh IDS for advanced correlation.
